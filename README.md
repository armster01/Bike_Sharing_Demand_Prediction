# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the bike-sharing demand using historical data. 
By analyzing various features such as weather conditions, date, and time, the model aims to provide accurate demand predictions for better operational efficiency in bike-sharing services.

This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to predict the demand using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

1. Datetime: The date and time of each observation.
2. Season: The season in which the data was recorded (spring, summer, fall, winter).
3. Weather: Weather conditions such as clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.
4. Temperature: The temperature in Celsius.
5. Humidity: The humidity level at the time of observation.
6. Windspeed: The wind speed at the time of observation.
7. Casual Users: The number of casual (non-registered) users.
8. Registered Users: The number of registered users.
9. Total Users: The total number of users.

## Problem Statement
